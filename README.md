# Morbid-Vegetarian-Castle

You play the game as a lettuce, having just come alive before being eaten by the red baron king, who fled in fear as you started sprouting legs and moving around in the bowl. The red baron king lived at the top of the castle and your goal is the escape, eventually freeing other pieces of fruit that has come to life. 
While escaping the castle, you meet different types of enemies who will try to defeat you.


Graphics: 
The game is set in a comic/childish animation style, to make it a fun game for children to play, that parents can eventually show their kids when they want them to eat their vegetables. It is set in fake 3D which allows you to move in both x and y directions to give you more freedom in movements and make the levels feel bigger.

Sounds:
The bosses will have fun lines that will sound serious, but will be hard to be taken serious in the context of a living lettuce, adding to the comical effect of the game. (Tanja records the lines)

We will use our unique letter whenever an enemy dies (UARD, Mathias records)

Since we use a fun, arcade style for our game, we will use the classic sound effects for picking up items, shooting your salad leaves, defeating enemies, walking and dying. These sounds will all be in bit style for old school feeling.

And lastly, we will have background music running, changing it for specific cases such as fighting bosses or freeing your allied fruits.

Level design:
We are getting inspiration from “Enter the Gungeon” for our game design and gameplay. The levels will be separated in “room” and “floor” and a floor will consist of multiple rooms. To enter the next floor, you will have to find a key that can open the door to the stairs. To find the key, you will have you explore the rooms until you find the one with the key in it. There will be multiple keys for multiple doors to reward exploration. 

Character: 
The main character, our lettuce, is a lettuce which has sprouted feet for unknown reasons (for now) and has come to life and is now trying to escape the castle alive.

Weapons:
Single shot: Standard attack - you shoot a lettuce leaf at an enemy, stopping them in their tracks for a few seconds, allowing you to defeat them with a melee attack.

Multishot: One of the available power ups in the game, allowing you to shoot multiple lettuce leaves to hit more enemies at once.

Rapidfire: One of the available power ups in the game, allowing you to shoot single leaf attacks in rapid succession, far faster than the standard leaf.

Pipebomb: Pipebomb is a special weapon you can pick up that does not replace your lettuce leaf attack, however it does take the power up spot of the other weapons. The "pipebomb" is a bomb you can throw that will attract the enemies for a set duration, allowing you to freely loot or do whatever you want while they are gone.

Melee: The only way to defeat an enemy. It is a close range attack that will defeat an enemy. It can only be used when the enemy has already been hit by a leaf attack to stun them and then you walk up behind them to use the melee.

Abilities: 
You have the ability to roll. It is a fast movement ability, primarily to be used for dodging. It has a cooldown to prevent it from being used constantly.

Power ups:
Seperate from the weapon power ups, these things buff your character instead of your weapon.
Rotten: You rot for a short amount of time, allowing you to evade the enemies because who wants to eat rotten salad?
Shield: You gain a shield, allowing you to absorb one hit.

Enemies:
We have a few types of enemies so far, to keep everything simple.
Vegetarian: Standard enemy, runs towards the player, hitting you and causing you damage.
Big man: Special enemy, slow, will defeat the player in one hit, disregarding shields and health.
Animals: When outside near the garden/greenhouse, there will be different types of animals, hunting you to tear your apart violently.

Bosses:
The first boss is the chef in the kitchen, who wants you for his salad. This is also where you first meet other pieces of living fruit for you to save. If you do not beat him fast enough, he will slowly kill the other living pieces, adding a sense of urgency to the fight.
The second boss you will fight is the gardener. The battle takes place in the garden, causing obstacles to appear throughout the fight, such as a sprinkler, a rake and more.
The third boss will be "The Red Baron King", who will be a very vicious foe for you to defeat...
